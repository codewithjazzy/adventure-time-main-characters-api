### What I learned

The motivation behind this project was to practice what I had learned about CRUD API methods.  
I learned:
- How to install node modules
- How to install the Express dependency
- Express routing methods, paths, handlers, and parameters
- How to use Postman to test my API locally



### Continued development

This is always a WIP and with time, I'd like to work on a few more ideas:

- Add HTML for user input
- Add Javascript event listeners for user input based search results
- Add CSS for flair
